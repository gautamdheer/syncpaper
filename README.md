# SyncPaper 

## Project Overview (Day 1) 
SyncPaper is a real-time collaborative document editing application designed to allow multiple users to simultaneously edit and collaborate on documents. This app is inspired by Google Docs, featuring live updates, chat functionality, and document versioning. The application is built using the MERN stack, with MongoDB for data storage, Express and Node.js for the back-end, and React for the front-end. It incorporates WebSockets for real-time communication, ensuring smooth synchronization across users. SyncPaper also includes user authentication, so users can create accounts, log in, and securely access their documents.
